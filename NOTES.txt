-we'll need a main -> doyyyy
-we'll need a gl viewer wrapper -> to be reused a lot later? -> look at GL code
-we'll need a scene to manage drawables
-we'll need a drawable subclass
	-GL buffers
	-get vertex buffer
	-get index buffer
	-get normal buffer

-we'll include a dedicated mesh drawable class
-HRBF draw will be a subclass of this
	-but HRBF itself will have to be a separate class

-HRBF segment will voxelize and push all the cubes to GL? is that crazy?
-maybe we'll do points for now... less taxing on the GPU?

TODO
-set up a starter repo using the 563 GL basecode (skeleton)
	-get GLFW working
	-get a basic drawable cube class working -> refer back to 460 for classing, subclassing
-get a basic mesh loader going
-think about how to visualize the HRBF
	-right now I'm thinking voxels
